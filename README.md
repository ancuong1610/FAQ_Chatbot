# FAQ Chatbot

## Features
- Converts FAQ data into a list of questions and answers.
- Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to transform text data into numerical vectors.
- Calculates cosine similarity between user questions and FAQ questions to find the most relevant answer.
- Allows users to interact with the chatbot via a command-line interface.
